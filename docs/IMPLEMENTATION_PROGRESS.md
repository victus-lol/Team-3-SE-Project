# Implementation Progress

Handoff notes for Aaryan Dubey (PES2UG24CS016), owner of `client/src/` per `docs/TEAM_ASSIGNMENTS.md`. Add or update the matching log entry in every commit so teammates can see progress as it lands.

## Current state

- The project is a React/Vite website backed by a Flask API, not a native mobile app.
- The team documentation, CI configuration, contribution rules, project setup instructions, Flask backend scaffold, and React/Vite client baseline are present.
- Backend routes and services reflect the existing source baseline; endpoint behavior should be checked against the API documentation and by the backend owners.
- The UI enhancements are committed in separate frontend-only batches.
- Backend ownership remains with the assigned team members; Aaryan’s feature changes are scoped to `client/src/` and this guide.

## Run locally

Use the root README for backend setup and the `client/` instructions. From `client/`, run `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, or `npm run build`. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` to `127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Integration notes

- Match endpoint names and response shapes in `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `docs/openapi.yaml`.
- Demo credentials only work once the auth API is implemented and the database is seeded.
- Run the repository CI checks before merge. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`: use a feature branch and PR with peer review; do not push directly to `main`.

## Commit log

| Commit | Date | Scope and handoff |
|---|---|---|
| chore: add project standards and docs | 2026-11-01 | Added team docs, CI configuration, contribution rules, scripts, and setup instructions while preserving the repository roster. Backend and frontend source follow in separate commits. |
| chore: add Flask backend scaffold | 2026-11-01 | Added the existing Flask app, models, routes, migrations, and backend tests. Backend implementation remains with its assigned owners. The client baseline follows next. |
| chore: add React client baseline | 2026-11-01 | Added the existing Vite app, frontend components, package metadata, and UI test setup. The next batches update the assigned frontend views and tests. |

## Remaining integration work

1. Finish the assigned frontend shell, auth UI, task/search/dashboard views, and notifications UI.
2. Validate those views against the Flask API, then check responsive layout, accessibility, and CI before merge.
